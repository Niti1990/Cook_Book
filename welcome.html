        Real food is at the heart of Nourished Kitchen. Real food is timeless.
        It is deeply nourishing, and a pleasure to eat. Real food is a slowly
        simmered pot of bone broth, a carefully crafted loaf of homemade
        no-knead sourdough bread, and a soul-warming beef and mushroom stew.
        It's homemade sauerkraut, and heirloom yogurt passed from friend to
        friend. A real food approach is one that examines the connections
        between how food is produced, how it is prepared, and how it nourishes
        our bodies on a deep and profound level. Real food is whole and
        minimally processed. It comes from the garden, from the wild, from your
        local farmers market and from artisan producers who have perfected the
        art of baking crusty loaves of sourdough breads, bright and salty sour
        pickles, farmstead jams and other nourishing foods..
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        At its simplest, real food are traditionally prepared, whole, minimally
        processed foods. Real foods are free from food additives, like
        artificial preservatives, flavors and colors. Conversely, real foods are
        also particularly rich in micronutrients like vitamins, minerals and
        various naturally occurring phytonutrients. Real foods are sustainably
        produced and are prepared in ways that enhance their nutrient-value.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Real food is fundamentally balanced. Real food is fundamentally
        balanced. It includes foods from plant origin like watercress,
        strawberries, lentils, spelt and olive oil as well as foods from animal
        origin like yogurt, eggs, broth, ghee, meat and fish. Both foods that
        originate from plants and those that originate from animals provide
        essential micronutrients. Some nutrients are only found in plant foods
        and other nutrients are only found in animal foods which is why a
        balance of both plant and animal foods, which is why a balanced,
        nonrestrictive and inclusive approach to eating supports your health the
        best.
